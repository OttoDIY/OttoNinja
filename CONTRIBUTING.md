Welcome to our Otto Builder community!

## 2. step two is to build your own Otto!
Start with the basic if you are a beginner; Otto DIY can be made easily with [our Builder Kit (full with 3D printed parts)](https://ottodiy.ecwid.com/Otto-DIY-Builder-Kit-p135022769) or  [Maker Kit (only electronics) if you have a 3D printer](https://ottodiy.ecwid.com/Otto-DIY-Maker-Kit-p135022782).

Once you feel more confident you can [jump to any of our other Otto robots](https://ottodiy.ecwid.com/) with more advanced features and sensors.

## 3. step three Make your contribution

If you noticed we have @divided our documenation in [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/projects) and [Github](https://github.com/OttoDIY/), this is because one tool is good for hardware the other for merely software, we also find out that one is easier to use for our main community audience but feel free to use any you feel comfortable with, currently we need support with:

* New Remixes or designs of similar robots you can just upload into Wikifactory Otto DIY projects [submit any creation you have made here](https://wikifactory.com/new-project) they help show the projects possibility and community collaboration.
* Language [translations for our Otto Blockly](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly) with this more people will learn how to code.
* In the same repository you can help us report issues or solve them or pull request other improvements.
* Ideas or [improvements for our mobile App!](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYApp)

or just send us the files we will upload for you and give the appropriate credits to you.

Happy to have you as a part ofÂ the Otto Community :) and thanks!
