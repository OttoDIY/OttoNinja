# Otto DIY ESP

This Repository have all open source Arduino sketch code files for Otto DIY an interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles. It is completely and truly open source, Arduino compatible, programmable, 3D printable.

Beginners please go and join our [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy) where you will find instruction manuals, 3D files and more, it is a similar platform much more easy to use, visual and simple for all the community to collaborate.

We are working in a promising new Otto robot with IoT capabilities, thanks to the ESP technology, be a part of this development!

## For fast programming and learning
1. Download our Blockly here https://www.ottodiy.com/#blockly-and-app ; visual programming, it is the easiest way to start to learn how to code, drag & drop simple blocks to tell your robot what to do, you dont need to install or setup any library, everything comes ready to open and upload your code into Otto robot, another Arduino board, ESP development boards or even Microbit and more.
2. Open an example, select Arduino Nano, connect your Otto via USB to computer.
3. Check and upload the code and that is all!

## For the advanced programmer
1. [Download & Install Arduino IDE 1.8.5 version](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) also [this driver if you have a clone board for PC] (http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html), [or for MAC](http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html)
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed)
3. Open  for example OttoDIY_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding USB port if you have a new vesrion of Arduino make sure to use the old bootloader or errors will appear.
4. Compile (Check) the code to make sure everything is installed properly.
5. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!
