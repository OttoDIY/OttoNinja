Is completely and truly open source, Arduino compatible, progeamable, 3D printable, once you have all components and tools you will be able to build your own Otto in only 1 hour! NO soldering  required 
you can just buy all cpmponents from us in our website http://www.ottodiy.com/
This is the entry version of otto DIY if you want to try Bluetooth connection, APP control, more sensors please go to [Otto DIY + (PLUS) repository](https://github.com/OttoDIY/PLUS)

## For the programming
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software also this driver if you have a clone board: http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html for PC, or http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html for MAC
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed):
3. Open  for example OTTO_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding port
4. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!
5. Make your own dance just modify the arduino code using same functions

### Otto was  design using Autodesk 123D Design software now in Thinkercad!
[You can modify it for customization](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1kI624iowUR-ottodiy/) or further improvements!

Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from [biped robot Zowi](https://github.com/bqlabs/zowi)
Otto's differences are in the assembled size (11cm x 7cm x12cm), cleaner integration of components and expressions.
